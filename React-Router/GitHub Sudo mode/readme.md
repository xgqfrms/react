# GitHub Sudo mode

https://help.github.com/articles/sudo-mode/



GitHub asks you for your password before you can modify your email address, authorize third-party applications, or add new public keys, or initiate other sudo-protected actions.

GitHub要求您输入密码，然后才能修改您的电子邮件地址，授权第三方应用程序或添加新的公共密钥，或者启动其他受sudo保护的操作。



After you've performed a sudo-protected action, you'll only be asked to re-authenticate again after a few hours of inactivity. Every sudo-protected action resets this timer.

执行受sudo保护的操作后，只有在几个小时不活动后，才会要求您重新进行身份验证。每个sudo保护的操作将重置此计时器。









## Continuous Integration

https://documentation.codeship.com/general/about/getting_started_with_ci/


Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD)


Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment are essential parts of agile software development. In agile software development, there is no versioning of software.

持续集成和持续部署是敏捷软件开发的重要组成部分。在敏捷软件开发中，没有软件的版本化。


Instead, builds get rolled out continuously, which means that new features and bugfixes are integrated almost instantly rather than waiting for the next version release.

相反，构建不断地推出，这意味着新功能和错误修正几乎立即集成，而不是等待下一个版本发布。


Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) are sometimes used interchangeably, although they mean different things.

连续集成（CI）和连续部署（CD）有时可以互换使用，尽管它们意味着不同的东西。




CI is the process of integrating changes into a code repository continuously with a process automatically testing the new or updated code with each code update.

CI是将更改连续地集成到代码库中的过程，其中每个代码更新自动测试新的或更新的代码。

CD happens after the testing process has successfully finished. In this step, the integrated changes are deployed to a staging or production environment.

CD在测试过程成功完成后发生。在此步骤中，集成更改将部署到暂存或生产环境。


Both these processes enable developers to work faster and more efficiently since the builds and deployments are automated once the initial setup of the CI/CD system was made.

这两个过程使开发人员能够更快更有效地工作，因为一旦CI / CD系统的初始设置完成，构建和部署就自动化。


In case a bug was shipped, the system can also be rolled back in the same manner, allowing for quick reactions and better user experience.

如果发送错误，系统也可以以相同的方式回滚，从而允许快速反应和更好的用户体验。
