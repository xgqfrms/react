# react-retrogames

The repository refers to the articles I wrote for Scotch.io:

[Retrogames Library with Node, React, and Redux 1: Server API and React Frontend](https://scotch.io/tutorials/retrogames-library-with-node-react-and-redux-1-server-api-and-react-frontend)

If you don't have *yarn* installed, go ahead and install it.
From npm:

```
npm install yarn -g
```

Then in the root folder run:

```
yarn
```

Check the package.json for the running scripts.
